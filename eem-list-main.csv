2163,IEA46,Process Systems,Painting,Install VFDs on exhaust and supply fans connected to the sensor installed on the compressed air line to the paint gun. VFDs allow reduction of exhaust and supply air into the paint booth when there is no paint spraying. Reducing the volume of air put through paint booth also limits the amount of energy to treat the supply and exhaust air
2164,IEA46,Process Systems,Painting,Use infrared paint curing. Infrared ovens replace gas-fired low-bake ovens to speed up the stoving process. Infrared process reduces energy consumption by reducing paint booth size and increases productivity by reducing stoving time.
2165,IEA46,Process Systems,Painting,"Use ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis (UF/RO) for wastewater cleaning. When the water-based paint is used, processing equipment must be regularly cleaned with water. A typical painting operation requires significant amount of water to clean, all of it must be disposed of as hazardous waste. Reducing this hazardous waste therefore reduces transportation and incineration energy associated with its removal. A combined UF/RO process cleans wastewater to the point where it is again suitable for cleaning purpose. The UF/RO can recover 95% of the waste water."
2166,IEA46,Process Systems,Painting,"Insulate the drying booth or tunnel. Insulation of the drying booth or tunnel can reduce the heat losses through irradiation, which can be about 5% of the total energy input."
2167,IEA46,Process Systems,Painting,"Fix badly functioning entry and exit doors of drying booths, which can cause additional heat losses."

2176,IEA46,Process Systems,Plating and metal finishing,"Use no-mask anode tooling technology to reduce labor cost, plating time and the amount of time needed to grind the surface after plating. Reduction in plating time results in increased throughput and reduced energy consumption (for tank heating and cooling and exhaust air transportation and scrubbing)."
2177,IEA46,Process Systems,Machining,"Use process enclosures connected to exhaust systems or having built-in fans and filter for turning (lathe), drilling, milling and grinding machines. For older machines use partial enclosures or local capture hoods."
2178,IEA46,Process Systems,Machining,Use area lighting system to deliver in a combination with a task (supplemental) lighting for workstations.
2179,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,"Select welding process that produces the least volume of fume consistent with other application considerations. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), plasma arc welding (PAW), and submerged arc welding (SAW) processes generally produce the lowest fume levels. Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is normally the process with the next lowest fume generation rate."
2180,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,"Use high-efficiency welding power sources, which have better electrical efficiency and an improved power factor. In high-efficiency welding, power to the transformer is shut off during system idling and cooling fans only run when needed. These power sources provide 10 to 40% energy savings over older units."
2181,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,"Use modern inverter welding power sources, which can reduce the fume generation for pulsed gas metal arc welding (GMAW-P) compared to conventional GMAW procedures."
2182,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,Selecting optimum welding voltage to reduce fume generation.
2183,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,Select welding electrodes with reduced fume generation. Electrodes and electrode coatings containing higher percentages of more volatile ingredients produce higher levels of fume.
2184,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,Select shielding gas with reduced fume generation for the GMAW and Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW) processes. Argon-based shielding gases with the lowest percentages of oxygen or carbon dioxide will minimize fume for both GMAW and FCAW. The fume generation rate can be cut almost in half by changing from 100% CO2 shielding gas to a mixture of Argon with 25% CO2 shielding gas. A further reduction in fume generation rate can be achieved by use of a shielding gas containing Argon with only 5% CO2 along with the appropriate electrode
2185,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,"Avoid, remove, or reduce oil film, paint, primer, rust, galvanizing or other coatings on the welded surfaces since these coatings increase fume."
2186,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,Reduce expulsion during spot welding.
2187,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,"Avoid short-time conditions with spot welding, changing over to medium-time conditions."

2191,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,"Install local exhaust, which captures the contaminants at or near their source, with manual and semiautomatic welding operations."
2192,IEA46,Process Systems,Welding,"Use built-in fixture exhaust system for repetitive arc and resistance manual and robotic welding operations. An engineered design to reduce exhaust air volume, increase capture effectiveness of fumes generated during and after welding operations. Requires cooperation of process and ventilation engineers."
